What I've always loved about **Linux** is its **customizability** and the **freedom** you have to configure your [rice][1] exactly you like it, especially when you pass the line of **D**esktop **E**nvironments to embrace more straightforward environments like [tiling manager][2]; this is where [Linux on the desktop shines][3].

**Tiling managers** allow **arranging windows** in non-overlapping **frames** and controlling any aspect using the **keyboard**, including opening, closing, moving, and resizing.

Like the most known desktop environments (including **macOS**), they also have the concept of **workspaces**, where you can organize your windows in a way you feel more productive.

In order of preference, the things I love about this workflow:

1. Opening a terminal with **Super+Enter**
2. Opening a new browser instance with **Super+Shift+Enter**
3. Move a window in another workspace with **Super+Shift+\[1,n\]**
4. Resize the windows (well, its frame) with **Super+r** plus the arrows

Now, **approaching to the core of this article**, **I use** both **Linux and macOS** daily, and I **share** most of the **dotfiles** between the systems (_i use_ [_yadm_][4]); everything works very well except the desktop workflow and the keyboard shortcuts that i cannot easily share.

### Tiling window managers on macOS ?

**macOS** **doesn't have a native windows tiling management** (well, there is one, but very limited to full-screen apps). Some open-source projects aim to fix that, like [Amethyst][5] or [Yabai][6]; I am currently using the **first one**, which is quite ok for casual usage but **very limited** for the most advanced scenarios; in that case, consider Yabai, which requires a **most complex installation** to take deeper control of the operating system part in charge of window management.

**Another significant** missing **is there isn't a simple way on macOS** to have a **shortcut** to spin up a new application (like a new terminal window) or a new instance of the already open program.

To do that, you must use a combination of stuff like **Automator** and **keyboard shortcuts** with many limitations on the usable keys; for example, it's impossible to use **Super+Enter** as a shortcut combination.

**It is frustrating** but **easily fixable** using a **small and ingenious** system **daemon** called [skhd][7].

### What is skhd ?

> **skhd** is a simple hotkey daemon for macOS that focuses on responsiveness and performance. Hotkeys are defined in a text file through a simple DSL. **skhd** is able to hotload its config file, meaning that hotkeys can be edited and updated live while **skhd** is running.

### How to use it?

Once installed brew and started the launchd service:

```shell
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd
skhd --start-service
```

You need to create a configuration file in one of the following locations (in order of preference):

```shell
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/skhd/skhdrc
- $HOME/.config/skhd/skhdrc
- $HOME/.skhdrc
```

And start adding your keyboard shortcuts, for now, i have just 2:

```shell {linenos=inline}

# https://git.arul.io/arul/dotfiles/src/branch/macOS/skhd/.config/skhd/skhdrc

# Open iterm2.
cmd - return : osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm2" to create window with default profile command ""' || open -na iTerm

# open Chrome.
cmd + shift - return : open -n -a "Google Chrome"
```

**With those two lines**, I've finally managed to have the **same shortcuts for both systems** and fix **something I've always felt very clunky for years** on **macOS**.

I hope you find this article useful, having a cozy environment is a crucial part of a good developer experience.
